# shopping-list
This Java application is designed to efficiently process scanned barcodes. It incorporates functionality to check the existence of scanned barcodes within an attached database. In cases where a barcode is not found, the application automatically performs a lookup to retrieve relevant information. It then compiles a comprehensive list of shopping items, which users can conveniently view through the Angular frontend or have it emailed to them.
